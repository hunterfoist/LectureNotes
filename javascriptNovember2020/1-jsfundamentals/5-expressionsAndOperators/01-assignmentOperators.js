//subtraction assignment operator
x -= 1; //x = x - 1

//multiplication assignment operator
x *= 2; //x = x * 2

//division assignment operator
x /= 4; //x = x / 4

//remainder (modulus) assignment operator
x %= 2

//modulus operator - spits out the remiainder of a quotient '%'

//exponential assignment operator
